# ep3d-highres-preprocessing
Complex-valued preprocessing pipelines for high-resolution structural and quantitative 3D-EPI imaging (e.g. T2*-weighted imaging, SWI, QSM, R2* mapping, MPM, R2 mapping, ...)

## basic-preprocessing
Basic nipype preprocessing as well as individually executable python scripts for separate steps of the preprocessing.

## extended-preprocessing
Extended nipype preprocessing pipeline as developed and used (similarly) in the Rhineland Study (https://www.rheinland-studie.de/en/). One of the differences to the Rhineland Study pipeline is the frequency-based phase matching for multi-TE data. Another difference is compatibility to single-TE data and data acquired using only a single phase encode polarity.
